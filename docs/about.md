<h2>For students:</h2>
<h3>Physical students</h3>
Registered students at the University of Copenhagen can physically participate and receive ECTS credits for this course. Therefore, they will need to fill out quizzes and submit their exercise hnd-ins through the University of Copenhagen system, <a href="[url]https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/72771">Absalon</a>. 

Rooms:
<ul>
    <li>Monday afternoon: &oslash;v - NBB 2.3.I.164, Jagtvej 155</li>
    <li>Wednesday morning: &oslash;v - NBB 2.3.I.164, Jagtvej 155</li>
    <li>Wednesday afternoon: aud - NBB 2.0.G.064/070, Jagtvej 155</li>
</ul>

<h3>Online students</h3>
Since this course is fully open, you are more than welcome to follow along. Unfortunately quizzes cannot be taken at this point, but they mostly check background knowledge. Exercises can be followed along using the provided Jupyter notebooks, but they will not be graded.

<h2>This is a flipped classroom course - What does this mean?</h2>
<p>The course is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are no formal lectures, we may present short overviews of topics as we go along.</li>
    <li>You will have to work in groups throughout all hours, teachers will be coaching and mentoring you during class hours.</li>
    <li>Weekly Jupyter notebooks will be distributed on the course web page on Absalon to help students with programming exercises and support students in making their hand-ins.</li>
    <li>Online quizzes will be available through the course web page.</li>
    <li>Video screencasts where the teachers give an overview of the syllabus slides will be distributed on the course web page and on YouTube.</li>
    <li>Slide material, notes, and other reading material will also be distributed through the course web page.</li>
    <li>All questions regarding slides, programming, hand-ins, the syllabus, and other direct course-related content must be asked during class hours. E-mails will in general be ignored if questions belong to the class hours.</li>
    <li>Students will be divided into random workgroups every week.</li>
    <li>All hand-in deadlines are strict. Students are allowed to hand in early; the TA will provide written feedback on hand-ins. We will try and have feedback available no later than one week after the respective hand-in deadline.</li>
    <li>Students are allowed to work together but hand-ins are individual and we will check for plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>We do not use a textbook. Slides, notes, articles, and copies of texts are available on this course web page.</p>
<h2>Hand-ins</h2>
<p>All hand-ins must be submitted as a maximum 5-page pdf file and one must use the ACM TOG overleaf latex template for writing the hand-in. Each hand-in assignment is accompanied by a Jupyter notebook with python code. The notebook is to be submitted with the hand-in as well.</p>

<h2>Weekly Layout</h2>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prepare for Monday by reading during Friday and the weekend.</li>
    <li>Continue to work in your study group on Tuesday to increase deep learning of the theory.</li>
    <li>Plan for Wednesday so you know what problems to ask your teacher about.</li>
    <li>Use Thursday and Friday to polish your bi-weekly hand-in, and add theory to the practical work you did during Wednesday's classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The class schedule is roughly as follows:</p>
