<p>
In order to support the learning process we provide weekly Jupyter notebooks. The Jupyter notebooks contain exercises that help you to understand the material.

<h1>Hand-ins for physical students</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Registered students at the University of Copenhagen will need to submit bi-weekly hand-ins that are loosely based on the weekly exercises presented in the above Jupyter notebooks.</li>
    <li> The hand-ins need to be submitted through the University of Copenhagen system,  <a href="https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/72771">Absalon</a>.</li>
    <li> Hand-ins must be submitted as a maximum 10 page pdf file in Absalon and must be made using the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-large-2-column-format-template/qwcgpbmkkvpq">ACM TOG overleaf latex template</a>.</li>
    <li> The code notebooks must be uploaded to <a href="https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/72771">Absalon</a> as well so teachers and teaching assistents have code solutions accessible if needed.</li>
    <li> Each weekly Jupyter notebook lists the learning objectives you need to fullfill in the bi-weekly hand-ins. You need to follow these learning objectives closely, since this is how you will be graded. So be precise with the information you include and discuss. </li>
    <li> A special focus in the hand-ins will be given to good scientific writing by which we mean presenting your understanding and supporting it with references.</li>
</ul>
